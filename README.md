## Description
EVE Online Marketplace (EOM) is a simplified version of what would be a marketplace in the game, adapted to better fit the scope of this course. This marketplace allows customers to list products they want, and providers are able to fulfill those orders. Conversely, providers can also list products for customers to purchase. In cases where a customer and provider list matching orders, the transaction is processed simultaneously in both directions to enhance efficiency.
